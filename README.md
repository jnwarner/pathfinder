# Pathfinder

The Pathfinder project seeks to accomplish the following tasks:
* Randomly generate unique mazes
* Use established pathfinding algorithms to solve these randomly generated mazes
* Simulate and use machine learning to determine where the algorithms succeed and fail
* Establish the best combination of algorithms for solving perfect mazes

Algorithms being used for solving:
* Depth First Search (DFS)
* Breadth First Search (BFS)
* Dijkstra's Algorithm

More will be added as the project continues
